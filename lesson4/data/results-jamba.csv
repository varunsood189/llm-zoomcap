This is done when you do not want to get rid of the row because it has valuable information contributing to other columns.,"You would first get the average of the column and save it to a variable, then replace the NaN values with the average variable.
This method is called imputing - when you have NaN/ null values in a column, but you do not want to get rid of the row because it has valuable information contributing to other columns.

"To initialize and train a Ridge regression model using scikit-learn, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Ridge Regression Model**:


  * Import the Ridge class from sklearn.linear_model.
  * Create an instance of the Ridge class, specifying the alpha parameter to control the regularization strength.
	
2. **Prepare Your Data**:


  * Ensure your features are numerical. If you have categorical features, encode them using techniques like OneHotEncoder.
  * Normalize your numerical features using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to ensure they are on a similar scale.
	
3. **Combine Features**:


  * Combine your normalized numerical features and encoded categorical features into a single feature matrix (X_train).
	
4. **Train the Model**:


  * Use the fit method to train the Ridge regression model on your training data (X_train, y_train).


Here is an example code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Define the numerical and categorical features
numerical_features = [...]  # List of numerical feature indices
categorical_features = [...]  # List of categorical feature indices

# Create a ColumnTransformer to normalize numerical features and encode categorical features
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', MinMaxScaler(), numerical_features),
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(sparse=True), categorical_features)
    ]
)

# Transform the features
X_train_transformed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X_train)

# Initialize the Ridge regression model
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0, solver='sag', random_state=42)

# Train the model
ridge.fit(X_train_transformed, y_train)
```

In this example:

* `numerical_features` and `categorical_features` are lists of feature indices.
* `ColumnTransformer` is used to apply different transformations to numerical and categorical features.
* `MinMaxScaler` is used to normalize numerical features.
* `OneHotEncoder` is used to encode categorical features, with `sparse=True` to handle the large number of categories efficiently.
* The `Ridge` class is initialized with an alpha value of 1.0 and the `sag` solver for optimization.
* The model is trained using the `fit` method.","Ridge regression is a linear regression technique used to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity (when independent variables are highly correlated) and prevent overfitting in predictive modeling.

"Using pandas.get_dummies() and DictVectorizer(sparse=False) incorrectly can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models. These methods produce one-hot encodings, which, when misapplied, lead to slower processing times and suboptimal results in both Logistic and Linear/Ridge Regression. Specifically, they can cause convergence warnings during the training process and generally yield poorer model performance. This issue is particularly pronounced with high cardinality features, such as car models, which can generate over 900 columns alone.

Additionally, applying fit methods to the validation dataset instead of just the training set can compromise the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. This is because it results in data leakage, where information from the validation or test set influences the training process. To prevent this, it's essential to fit the model only on the training data and then transform the validation and test sets accordingly. This approach ensures that the model learns from the training data without being influenced by the validation or test data, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.","(Question by Connie S.)

"The Scikit-learn library can be used to verify precision, recall, and F1-score. The library provides functions such as `precision_score`, `recall_score`, and `f1_score` which can be used to calculate these metrics directly. Additionally, the `classification_report` function can be used to get all classification metrics simultaneously.","I am getting multiple thresholds with the same F1 score, does this indicate I am doing something wrong or is there a method for choosing?

Humberto Rodriguez",c5fdeba9,What does the error message about needing samples of at least 2 classes mean?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"To solve the ValueError related to having only 0's in the churn column, you need to ensure that your data contains samples of at least two classes. The error indicates that your churn column only contains 0's, which means there are no samples for the other class (1's). 

Here's how you can address this issue:

1. **Check your data preprocessing steps**: Ensure that the transformation `df.churn = (df.churn == 'yes').astype(int)` is correctly converting the churn column to 1's and 0's based on the 'yes' and 'no' values in your original data.


2. **Verify the original data**: Make sure that your original data actually contains both 'yes' and 'no' values in the churn column. If it doesn't, you need to correct the data at the source.


3. **Remove any incorrect transformations**: If you have any cells in your notebook that incorrectly transform the data to only 0's, delete those cells to ensure the data remains accurate.

"To evaluate the feature importance for numerical variables using AUC in sklearn, you can use the `roc_auc_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module. Here's how to do it:

1. **Pass the Target Variable and Feature Values:**


  * The `roc_auc_score` function expects two parameters: `y_true` and `y_score`.
  * Pass the vector of the target variable (e.g., `above_average`) as the first argument.
  * Pass the vector of feature values as the second argument.
	
2. **Example Code:**


```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# Assuming df_train is your dataframe and col is the column name of the feature
y_true = df_train['above_average']
y_score = df_train[col]

# Compute the AUC score for the feature
auc_score = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score)

print(f'AUC Score for feature {col}: {auc_score}')
```


3. **Handling Errors:**


  * Ensure that you pass the parameters correctly: `roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score)`.
  * If you encounter a `ValueError: multi_class must be in ('ovo', 'ovr')`, it means the parameters were passed incorrectly. The correct way is shown in the example above.
	
4. **Model Evaluation:**


  * You can compute other evaluation metrics similarly using functions from `sklearn.metrics`.


By following these steps, you can evaluate the importance of numerical features using AUC in sklearn.","You can use roc_auc_score function from sklearn.metrics module and pass the vector of the target variable (‘above_average’) as the first argument and the vector of feature values as the second one.

Stratified k-fold is used for multiclass classification.,"For multiclass classification it is important to keep class balance when you split the data set. In this case Stratified k-fold returns folds that contains approximately the sme percentage of samples of each classes.

Olga Rudakova",927b5e09,What type of classification is Stratified k-fold used for?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"Maintaining class balance in multiclass classification is important because it helps ensure that the model performs well across all classes. When the classes are balanced, each class is equally represented in the training and validation sets, which leads to a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance. Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a technique used to maintain class balance by ensuring that each fold contains approximately the same percentage of samples from each class. This is particularly important in multiclass classification because it helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and ensures that the performance metrics accurately reflect the model's ability to classify all classes correctly.","For multiclass classification it is important to keep class balance when you split the data set.

"Running the docker containers with the `--rm` flag is a best practice to prevent the accumulation of abandoned docker images in your system. These images consume extra space on your disk, and using the `--rm` option ensures that the containers are automatically removed upon exit, freeing up space.","What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?
For best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.
They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.

"To resolve an error during the installation of a Pipfile inside a Docker container, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the Pipfile.lock by running `pipenv lock`.
2. Use the command `RUN pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile` in your Dockerfile.
3. If the error persists, delete the Pipfile.lock, rebuild the lock using `pipenv lock`, and retry the Docker build command.
4. If the issue still isn't resolved, remove the pipenv environment and Pipfile.lock, create a new one, and then rebuild the Docker image.
5. Ensure that you have used pipenv to install the necessary modules, including gunicorn.
6. Use `pipenv shell` before building and running your Docker image.
7. Make sure the Python version in your Dockerfile matches the version installed on your system.
8. Add the Python installation folder to the PATH and restart your system if you encounter issues with Python versions.","I tried the first solution on Stackoverflow which recommended running `pipenv lock` to update the Pipfile.lock.

"If running `pipenv lock` doesn't resolve the issue with the Pipfile.lock installation, you can try the following steps based on the context provided:

1. **Manually Update Dependency Files**:


  * Manually change the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files.
	
2. **Switch to Pipenv Installation**:


  * Use the following command to switch to the pipenv installation:
	```bash
	pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile
	```


3. **Delete and Rebuild Pipfile.lock**:


  * Delete the `Pipfile.lock` file:
	```bash
	rm Pipfile.lock
	```
  * Rebuild the lock file:
	```bash
	pipenv lock
	```
  * Retry the Docker build command.
	
4. **Remove and Recreate Pipenv Environment**:


  * Remove the pipenv environment and the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files:
	```bash
	pipenv --rm
	rm Pipfile*
	```
  * Create a new pipenv environment and rebuild Docker.
	
5. **Resolve Version Conflicts**:


  * If you encounter a version conflict error, open the `Pipfile` in a nano editor and remove either the `python_version` or `python_full_version` line. Save the changes and run:
	```bash
	pipenv lock
	```
  * Continue with your tasks.

"To rebuild and run a Docker image correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Rebuild the Docker Image**:


  * Ensure you update the model in your file when running your prediction test.
  * Use the `--rm` flag during development and testing to get containers auto-removed upon exit. This prevents abandoned docker images from consuming extra space on your disk.
  * If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag.
  * Use the command `docker images` to see all the images you have pulled or built so far.
	
2. **Run the Docker Container**:


  * Use the `--rm` flag to auto-remove containers upon exit: `docker run --rm <image>`.
  * If you encounter issues, ensure you have used pipenv to install the necessary modules including gunicorn. Use `pipenv shell` before building and running your docker image.
	
3. **Debugging**:


  * To debug a running container, execute a command in the specific container:
	```sh
	docker ps (find the container-id)
	docker exec -it <container-id> bash
	```


  * To launch the container image in interactive mode and start a bash command:
	```sh
	docker run -it --entrypoint bash <image>
	```


4. **Mac M1 Chipset**:


  * If you encounter errors building the Docker image on the Mac M1 chipset, update your Dockerfile to include the platform specification:
	```Dockerfile
	FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ubuntu:latest
	```


  * This fix may cause the build process to take over 2 hours, but it should complete successfully.

"Bagging and boosting are two different techniques used in ensemble algorithms. Bagging, which stands for ""Bootstrap Aggregation,"" involves taking multiple samples with replacement from the original training dataset to create several training datasets. A classifier is then trained on each of these datasets, and the predictions are combined to obtain the final prediction. This method is done in parallel since the classifiers are independent, and it decreases variance but not bias. It is also robust against overfitting.

On the other hand, boosting is a sequential method where each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights, with those misclassified by the previous classifier given higher weights. This process continues until a stopping condition is reached. Boosting reduces bias and is generally more accurate than bagging, but it can be prone to overfitting.","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max.

"Answer: Possible issues when your model doesn't improve accuracy and loss:

1. Check that the augmented ImageDataGenerator still includes the option “rescale” as specified in the preceding step.
2. In the homework, you should set class_mode='binary' while reading the data.
3. The problem occurs when you choose the wrong optimizer, batch size, or learning rate.
4. Running the code on google collab or another way may help. The answers were closer for me on collab. Another tip is to change the runtime to use T4 and the model run’s faster than just CPU.
5. You need to create a list of all features in this question and evaluate the model one time to obtain the accuracy, this will be the original accuracy, and then remove one feature each time, and in each time, train the model, find the accuracy and the difference between the original accuracy and the found accuracy. Finally, find out which feature has the smallest absolute accuracy difference.
6. Since the order of subtraction between the two accuracy scores can result in a negative number, we will take its absolute value as we are interested in the smallest value difference, not the lowest difference value. Case in point, if difference is -4 and -2, the smallest difference is abs(-2), and not abs(-4).
7. We should select the “smallest” difference, and not the “lowest”, meaning we should reason in absolute values.
8. If the difference is negative, it means that the model actually became better when we removed the feature.","Problem description

"You should explicitly specify the number of channels in the Input layer of the model. For example, if the input shape is (input_size, input_size, 3), you need to specify the number of channels as 3 in the Input layer. Here is the corrected code:

"To address the error 'The system cannot find the file specified' in Docker on Windows, you should check the following:

1. **Ensure Correct Dockerfile Naming**: Make sure your Dockerfile is named correctly. It should be named `Dockerfile` without any extensions. Avoid naming it as `Dockerfile.dockerfile`.


2. **Check File Paths**: Verify that all file paths specified in your Dockerfile are correct and that the files exist at those locations.


3. **Use Double Quotes**: When specifying files in your Dockerfile, use double quotes instead of single quotes. For example:


```dockerfile
COPY [""model2.bin"", ""dv.bin"", ""./""]
```


4. **Add Python to PATH**: If you encounter issues related to Python versions, ensure that the Python installation folder is added to your system's PATH and restart your system.

"Your lambda function passes local tests but fails on a running Docker instance because the model returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values, which need to be converted to base-Python floats to be serializable.

For example, if your model returns numpy float32 values, you can convert them to base-Python floats like this:

```python
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), float(1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]

I found this solution from this question here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76102508/valueerror-cannot-set-tensor-got-value-of-type-float64-but-expected-type-float :
# Need to convert to float32 before set_tensor
X = np.float32(X)
Then, it works. I work with tensorflow 2.15.0, maybe the fact that this version is more recent involves this change ?
Added by Mélanie Fouesnard",819afebc,What type does the tensor expect for the input when using interpreter.set_tensor?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"Yes, the version of TensorFlow used can affect the solution for the interpreter.set_tensor error. As noted in the FAQ, using TensorFlow 2.15.0 led to the need to convert the input to float32 before using set_tensor. Additionally, it is mentioned that the TensorFlow and TensorFlow Serving versions need to match, indicating that version compatibility can impact the error and its solution.","I had this error when running the command line : interpreter.set_tensor(input_index, x) that can be seen in the video 9.3 around 12 minutes.
ValueError: Cannot set tensor: Got value of type UINT8 but expected type FLOAT32 for input 0, name: serving_default_conv2d_input:0
This is because the X is an int but a float is expected.

"To create and push a Docker image for AWS Lambda, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile** based on the AWS Lambda base image. For example:


```dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10

# Add your function code and dependencies
COPY . .

# Install any necessary dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set the CMD to your handler
CMD [ ""your_handler"" ]
```


2. **Build the Docker image** using the following command:


```sh
docker build -t your_image_name .
```


3. **Tag the Docker image** for ECR:


```sh
docker tag your_image_name aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/your_repository_name:your_tag
```


4. **Push the Docker image** to ECR:


```sh
aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/your_repository_name:your_tag
```

1. **Use a Different Version**: The `tflite_runtime` package is not available for all OS-Python version combinations. Check the available versions and find a matching combination. You can also try different versions available on GitHub.


2. **Use TensorFlow's TFLite**: For local development, you can use the TFLite included in TensorFlow. However, for testing Lambda, you should use Docker.

"To test AWS Lambda with Docker locally, you can use the AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator). If your Docker image is built on the base AWS Lambda image, you can follow these steps:

1. Run the Docker image as a container using a specific port for ""docker run"" and a specific ""localhost link"" for testing:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
```


2. This command starts up an endpoint locally at:
```bash
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations
```


3. Post an event to the following endpoint using a curl command. Here are examples for both Windows and Unix testing:
  * Windows testing:
	```bash
	curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d ""{\""url\"": \""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg\""}""
	```


  * Unix testing:
	```bash
	curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{""url"": ""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg""}'
	```


If you encounter an error during testing, such as:
```bash
{""errorMessage"": ""Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable"", ""errorType"": ""Runtime.MarshalError"", ""requestId"": ""7ea5d17a-e0a2-48d5-b747-a16fc530ed10"", ""stackTrace"": []}

Added by Daniel Egbo",5bda3b94,Who provided the solution for the TensorFlow Serving issue on Apple M1 Mac?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"To solve the Illegal instruction error when running the tensorflow/serving image on Mac M2 Apple Silicon, you should use the bitnami/tensorflow-serving base image instead. You can launch it using the following docker run command:

```bash
docker run -d \
--name tf_serving \
-p 8500:8500 \
-p 8501:8501 \
-v $(pwd)/clothing-model:/bitnami/model-data/1 \
-e TENSORFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_NAME=clothing-model \
bitnami/tensorflow-serving:2
```

Alternatively, you can use the following docker-compose.yaml file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  tf_serving:
    image: bitnami/tensorflow-serving:2
    volumes:
      - ${PWD}/clothing-model:/bitnami/model-data/1

3. Search for your hash value under the (reviewer_hash) heading in the spreadsheet.
4. Review the three assigned peer projects that correspond to your hash value.","I am not sure how the project evaluate assignment works? Where do I find this? I have access to all the capstone 2 project, perhaps, I can randomly pick any to review.

The link provided for example (2023/Capstone link ): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgoepohpgbM4MWTAHWuXa6r3NXKnxKcg4NDOm0bElAdXdnnA/viewform contains a list of all submitted projects to be evaluated. More specific, you are to review 3 assigned peer projects. In the spreadsheet are 3 hash values of your assigned peer projects. However, you need to derive the your hash value of your email address and find the value on the spreadsheet under the (reviewer_hash) heading.
To calculate your hash value run the python code below:
from hashlib import sha1
def compute_hash(email):
return sha1(email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
# Example usage **** enter your email below (Example1@gmail.com)****
email = ""Example1@gmail.com""
hashed_email = compute_hash(email)
print(""Original Email:"", email)
print(""Hashed Email (SHA-1):"", hashed_email)
Edit the above code to replace Example1@gmail.com as your email address
Store and run the above python code from your terminal. See below as the Hashed Email (SHA-1) value
You then go to the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR-7RRtq7AMx5OzI-tDbkzsbxNLm-NvFOP5OfJmhCek9oYcDx5jzxtZW2ZqWvBqc395UZpHBv1of9R1/pubhtml?gid=876309294&single=true
Lastly, copy the “Hashed Email (SHA-1): bd9770be022dede87419068aa1acd7a2ab441675” value and search for 3 identical entries. There you should see your peer project to be reviewed.

"To convert the `day_of_the_month` and `month_of_the_year` columns into a single `day_of_the_year` column in pandas, follow these steps:

1. Convert the `day_of_the_month` column to string type.
2. Map the `month_of_the_year` column values to their corresponding numeric values (e.g., jan to 1, feb to 2, etc.).
3. Combine the `day_of_the_month` and `month_of_the_year` columns into a datetime object.
4. Extract the `dayofyear` from the datetime object.

Here is the code to achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your DataFrame
df['day_of_the_month'] = df['day_of_the_month'].map(str)

# Example mapping for month_of_the_year
month_map = {'jan': '01', 'feb': '02', 'mar': '03', 'apr': '04', 'may': '05', 'jun': '06', 
             'jul': '07', 'aug': '08', 'sep': '09', 'oct': '10', 'nov': '11', 'dec': '12'}

df['month_of_the_year'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map(month_map)

# Combine the columns into a datetime object
df['date_formatted'] = pd.to_datetime(dict(year='2055', month=df['month_of_the_year'], day=df['day_of_the_month']))

# Extract the day of the year
df['day_of_year'] = df['date_formatted'].dt.dayofyear

"To transform month_of_the_year values like 'jan' and 'feb' into integers in pandas, you can use the map() function. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a dictionary with month abbreviations and their corresponding integer values:**

```python
month_dict = {'jan': '1', 'feb': '2', 'mar': '3', 'apr': '4', 'may': '5', 'jun': '6', 
              'jul': '7', 'aug': '8', 'sep': '9', 'oct': '10', 'nov': '11', 'dec': '12'}
```

2. **Apply this dictionary to the month_of_the_year column using map():**

```python
df['month_of_the_year'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map(month_dict)
```

This will convert the month abbreviations in the month_of_the_year column into their corresponding integer values.","Problem description: I have one column day_of_the_month .

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'day_of_the_month': [1, 2, 20, 25],
    'month_of_the_year': ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr']

# Convert month_of_the_year to numeric representation
df['month_of_the_year'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map({
    'jan': '01',
    'feb': '02',
    'mar': '03',
    'apr': '04',
    'may': '05',
    'jun': '06',
    'jul': '07',
    'aug': '08',
    'sep': '09',
    'oct': '10',

)

# Get day of the year
df['day_of_year'] = df['date_formatted'].dt.dayofyear

This command copies the specified model files from your local directory into the container's filesystem. If you encounter issues with specific model files not being found, you can use a wildcard to include all files from your working directory:

"No, it is not always best to train a model only on the most important features. Any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included. This can be determined by evaluating the model's performance with and without the feature. If excluding a feature reduces performance, it should be retained. Additionally, some features that are individually important may be highly correlated with others, making it acceptable to drop some of them.","I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?
Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).

Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).

Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ. The purpose of this document is to capture frequently asked technical questions. We did this for our data engineering course and it worked quite well. Check this document for inspiration on how to structure your questions and answers: Data Engineering Zoomcamp FAQ. In the course GitHub repository there’s a link. Here it is: https://airtable.com/shryxwLd0COOEaqXo.","You can consider several different approaches:
Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
Using Dask, an open-source python project which parallelizes Numpy and Pandas.
