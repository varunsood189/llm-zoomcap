Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)\\n3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:\\nimport pyspark\\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\\nfrom pyspark.conf import SparkConf\\nfrom pyspark.context import SparkContext\\n4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here’s my code snippet:\\nconf = SparkConf() \\\\\\n.setMaster(\\'local[*]\\') \\\\\\n.setAppName(\\'test\\') \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.jars\", \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl\",  \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.impl\", \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\")\\n5.)

Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\\nThe right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\\nDuring development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in.

XGBoost uses gradient descent to calculate and update the model. In gradient descent, we are looking for the minimum weights that help the model to learn the data very well. This minimum weights for the features is updated each time the model passes through the features and learns the features during training. Tuning the learning rate helps you tell the model what speed it would use in deriving the minimum for the weights.',\n",

       "   {'text': 'For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.\\nRandom Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\\nMélanie Fouesnard\\nBagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\\nRileen',\n",

At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?\\nNot necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).\\nBy Rileen Sinha\",\n",

If the target variable is passed in as a parameter while fitting the model, chances are the model would score extremely low. However, that’s not what you would want and would much like to have your model predict that. A good way to check that is to make sure your X_train doesn’t contain any part of your y_train.

Get used to solving problems and reading documentation. This will be a real life skill you need when employed. [ctrl+f] is your friend, use it! It is a universal shortcut and works in all apps/browsers.\\nWhat does the error say? There will often be a description of the error or instructions on what is needed or even how to fix it. I have even seen a link to the solution. Does it reference a specific line of your code?\\nRestart app or server/pc.\\nGoogle it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc.\\nIt is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution.\\nSearch using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.\\nThere are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments.\\nCheck the tech’s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function.\\nTry uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Remember to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.\\nSometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.\\nPost your question to Stackoverflow. Read the Stackoverflow guide on posting good questions.\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask\\nThis will be your real life. Ask an expert in the future (in addition to coworkers).\\nAsk in Slack\\nBefore asking a question,\\nCheck Pins (where the shortcut to the repo and this FAQ is located)\\nUse the slack app’s search function\\nUse the bot @ZoomcampQABot to do the search for you\\ncheck the FAQ (this document), use search [ctrl+f]\\nWhen asking a question, include as much information as possible:\\nWhat are you coding on? What OS?\\nWhat command did you run, which video did you follow? Etc etc\\nWhat error did you get? Does it have a line number to the “offending” code and have you check it for typos?\\nWhat have you tried that did not work? This answer is crucial as without it, helpers would ask you to do the suggestions in the error log first. Or just read this FAQ document.\\nDO NOT use screenshots, especially don’t take pictures from a phone.\\nDO NOT tag instructors, it may discourage others from helping you. Copy and paste errors; if it’s long, just post it in a reply to your thread.\\nUse ``` for formatting your code.\\nUse the same thread for the conversation (that means reply to your own thread).\\nDO NOT create multiple posts to discuss the issue.\\nlearYou may create a new post if the issue reemerges down the road. Describe what has changed in the environment.\\nProvide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.\\nTake a break and come back later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest. Get some fresh air, workout, play a video game, watch a tv show, whatever allows your brain to not think about it for a little while or even until the next day.\\nRemember technology issues in real life sometimes take days or even weeks to resolve.\\nIf somebody helped you with your problem and it's not in the FAQ, please add it there.

      "Here are five questions a student might ask based on the provided FAQ record, along with the answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Question:** What causes the \"Out of bounds\" error when reading parquet files directly into pandas from nyc.gov?\n",
      "**Answer:** The error is caused by an errant data record where the dropOff_datetime was set to the year 3019 instead of 2019. This exceeds the range that pandas can handle with the \"timestamp[ns]\" format.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Question:** How can I fix the \"Out of bounds\" error when reading parquet files into pandas?\n",
      "**Answer:** You can use pyarrow to read the parquet files and handle the datetime columns separately. This involves reading the datetime columns with `errors='coerce'` to convert out-of-bounds timestamps and using `parquet.compute.filter` to remove the offending rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Question:** Why does pandas have trouble with timestamps beyond the year 2300?\n",
      "**Answer:** Pandas uses \"timestamp[ns]\" for datetime columns, which is based on int64. This allows for a range of approximately 580 years centered on 2000. Timestamps beyond this range, such as the year 3019, are out of bounds for pandas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Question:** What is the role of the `errors='coerce'` parameter when reading datetime columns with pyarrow?\n",
      "**Answer:** The `errors='coerce'` parameter converts out-of-bounds timestamps into either the maximum or minimum representable timestamp, allowing the data to be read without causing an error.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Question:** How do I remove the rows with out-of-bounds timestamps after reading the parquet file with pyarrow?\n",
      "**Answer:** You can use the `parquet.compute.filter` function to filter out rows with timestamps greater than `pd.Timestamp.max`, ensuring only valid timestamps are included in the final DataFrame.\n",

The suitable type would be StringType. Spark inferSchema is more accurate than Pandas infer type method in this case. You can set it to true while reading the csv, so you don\\u2019t have to take out any data from your dataset. Something like this can help: df = spark.read .options( header = \\\"true\\\", inferSchema = \\\"true\\\", ) .csv('path/to/your/csv/file/') Solution B: It's because some rows in the affiliated_base_number are null and therefore it is assigned the datatype String and this cannot be converted to type Double. So if you really want to convert this pandas df to a pyspark df only take the rows from the pandas df that are not null in the 'Affiliated_base_number' column. Then you will be able to apply the pyspark function createDataFrame. # Only take rows that have no null values pandas_df= pandas_df[pandas_df.notnull().all(1)]\"\n",

Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning', 'question': 'What is the difference between bagging and boosting?', 'answer': 'For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.\\nRandom Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\\nMélanie Fouesnard\\nBagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\\nRileen'}, 'questions': ['What is bagging and how does it work?', 'What is boosting and how does it differ from bagging?', 'Can you explain the process of Bootstrap Aggregation in bagging?', 'How does XGBoost use boosting to improve model accuracy?', 'What are the advantages and disadvantages of bagging and boosting?']}\n",

Solution: In Grafana that would be a stat panel (just a number) and scatter plot panel (I believe it requires a plug-in). However, there is no native way to quickly recreate this exact Evidently dashboard. You\\'d need to make sure you have all the relevant information logged to your Grafana data source, and then design your own plots in Grafana. If you want to recreate the Evidently visualizations externally, you can export the Evidently output in JSON with include_render=True (more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/json-dict-output) and then parse information from it for your external visualization layer. To include everything you need for non-aggregated visuals, you should also add \"raw_data\": True option (more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/report-data-aggregation). Overall, this specific plot with under- and over-performance segments is more useful during debugging, so might be easier to access it ad hoc using Evidently.
